# Clickstream WP Plugin

A WordPress plugin for tracking user clickstream data.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Git

### Quick Start
1. Clone this repository: `git clone git@github.com:build-stack/clickstream-wp.git`
2. Run `chmod +x generate-config-keys.sh && ./generate-config-keys.sh` to generate secure WordPress salt keys
3. Run `docker-compose up -d`
4. Access WordPress at http://localhost:8000
5. The Clickstream WP plugin will be automatically available in the WordPress admin

## Docker Configuration

This project uses Docker to create a development environment with WordPress and MariaDB:

- **WordPress**: runs on port 8000 (http://localhost:8000)
- **MariaDB**: database exposed on port 3307

The Docker setup includes:
- WordPress with PHP 8.2 and Apache
- MariaDB as the database
- Volume mapping for the plugin and themes
- Custom wp-config.php with pre-configured database settings

## WordPress Configuration

The project includes a pre-configured wp-config.php file with database settings already set up. The main configuration includes:

- Database settings matching the MariaDB Docker container
- Debug mode enabled for development
- Security keys and salts (generated by the setup script)

### Auto-configuration

When you first access WordPress at http://localhost:8000, you'll only need to provide:
   - **Site Title**: Your Site Name
   - **Username**: admin (recommended)
   - **Password**: Choose a strong password (ALHA7IWxQSd5i&bE(C)
   - **Email**: your-email@example.com

### Manual Configuration

If you prefer to manually configure WordPress:

1. Visit http://localhost:8000 in your browser
2. Follow the standard WordPress setup process
3. The database settings are pre-configured, so you won't need to enter them

## Plugin Development

The Clickstream WP plugin is located in the `clickstream-wp` directory and mounted directly into the WordPress container.

To develop the plugin:
1. Edit files in the `clickstream-wp` directory
2. Changes will be immediately available in WordPress
3. Activate the plugin in the WordPress admin under Plugins

## Database Access

You can connect to the MariaDB database using:
- **Host**: localhost
